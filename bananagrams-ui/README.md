## Getting Started
### Setting up your dev environment
2. Install version 16.6.0 of NodeJS.
3. Install yarn. On windows, you can do this using the command `npm install -g yarn`. On mac, install using homebrew and the command `brew install yarn`.
4. Install the recommended workspace extensions.
5. Select the `Use Workspace Version` for your typescript installation. VS Code may prompt you to do this, or you can:
    - Open a .tsx file
    - Press `ctrl+shift+p`
    - Find the `Typescript:Select a Typescript version...` option and select `Use Workspace Version`
        - NOTE: If you cannot find the option, be sure you have the react project folder as your root directory in VS Code!
6. Run `yarn install`

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
